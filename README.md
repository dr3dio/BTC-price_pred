# BTC ARIMA MODEL

This project focuses on utilizing an ARIMA model for predicting the next day's closing price of btc/usd.

# Using ARIMA on btc/usd price history (timestep = daily)
In this project I explain the ARIMA model and provide a use case for predicting the next day's closing price for bitcoin. The final model uses the pmdarima library for Python 3 and import's the auto_arima method for prediction. The model has a Mean Absolute Percetnage Error of 0.027 incidcating that ARIMA is a fitting model for short term prediction.
